# some cool features
* sound (step, shot) 3d circles
* aimbot through mouse for SMAC (for rage too, but needs a little rework (like cvars))
* legit backtrack (needs a little rework to get more than 10 ticks adequately) with bt chams/dots
* knifebot with legit backtrack for knife
* aimbot through viewangles with little bypass for SMAC (cmd->mousedx/y)
* self-written menu with console (system allows you to easy add new variables)
* fake ping (outdated, needs new signature)
* flashlight spam (with fakelag on 1 makes it invisible)
* nightmode
* slowmotion

maybe i will return to it when i have time and desire to work on it
