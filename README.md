# lovemachine_css
lovemachine for css (steam)

code is pretty messy and some features can be outdated/not complete

# some cool features
* legit backtrack (needs a little rework) with bt chams/dots
* legit backtrack for knife
* aimbot through mouse input, not cmd viewangles
* self-written menu with console (system allows you to easy add new variables) and d3d class (lines are not working and i didn't have time to fix this)
* fake ping (outdated, needs new signature)
* flashlight spam (with fakelag on 1 makes it invisible)
* nightmode

may be i will return to it when i have time and desire to work on it

# console commands
* echo ... - prints whatever you write
* panic - turns off all features and menu (can be enabled back by NUM5)
* load ... - loads config
* save ... - saves config
* config_list - prints configs you have
* reset_fonts

variables:
* vm_fov - viewmodel fov
* kb_range - knifebot distance to work
* nightmode - percent of wall darkness
* antismac - smac proof functions
* ragemode - rage functions
