# lovemachine_css
lovemachine for css (steam)

code is pretty messy and some features can be outdated/not complete

some cool features:
- legit backtrack (needs a little rework) with bt chams/dots
- legit backtrack for knife
- self-written menu with console and d3d class (lines are not working and i didn't have time to fix this)
- fake ping (outdated, needs new signature)
- flashlight spam (with fakelag on 1 makes it invisible)
